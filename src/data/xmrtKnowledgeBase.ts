    topic: "SupportXMR API Integration and Data Interpretation",
    content: `Eliza can interpret and explain mining performance metrics from the SupportXMR pool:

        PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
        - Hash rates below 1 KH/s indicate mobile mining or low-power devices
        - Hash rates 1-5 KH/s suggest optimized mobile or lightweight desktop mining
        - Share acceptance rates above 95% indicate good network connectivity
        - Payout thresholds typically set at 0.001-0.01 XMR minimum

        TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDANCE:
        - Zero hash rate: Check mining software connection
        - Low share acceptance: Verify pool configuration and network stability
        - No payouts: Confirm minimum threshold reached and wallet address accuracy

        OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
        - Mobile devices: Use thermal management and battery optimization
        - Network efficiency: Ensure stable internet for consistent share submission`,
