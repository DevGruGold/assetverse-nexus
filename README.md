### How Eliza Works

1. **Powered by Lovable AI Gateway**: Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model with free tier access
2. **Supabase Edge Function**: `ai-chat` function processes requests with full context injection
3. **Real-time Data Integration**: Fetches live mining stats from `unifiedDataService`
4. **Fallback System**: Local LLM (Qwen2.5-0.5B) provides offline capability
5. **Conversation Persistence**: All chats stored in Supabase for continuity

### Example Conversations

**"What are my current mining stats?"**
> *"You're currently mining at 625 H/s on the SupportXMR pool. You've submitted 120,440 valid shares with 0 invalid shares (100% efficiency). Your pending balance is 0.008142 XMR with 0 XMR already paid out across 0 transactions. Last hash was submitted 2 minutes ago - you're actively mining!"*

**"Is mobile mining profitable?"**
> *"Based on your 625 H/s hashrate, you'll earn approximately 0.00156 XMR per day ($0.23 at current prices). After electricity costs (~$0.05/day), your daily profit is around $0.18. Monthly profit: $5.40. Profitability increases with XMR price appreciation and lower energy costs."*

**"How do I optimize battery life while mining?"**
> *"Here are smart strategies for battery preservation: 1) Mine only while plugged in, 2) Use thermal throttling to prevent overheating, 3) Reduce screen brightness or turn off display, 4) Enable battery optimization in settings, 5) Schedule mining during off-peak hours. XMRT's built-in thermal management automatically adjusts hashrate to protect your device."*

### Privacy & Security
